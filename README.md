# Discordbot_Techxas
This is the initial release of a bot while I learn and modify along my way. Tutorials and information I used are listed below:

TODO:
 * Add ability for bot to read token from text file.
 * In the Twitch and Twitter module use Discord profile data to auto-fill links. Currently Links are static to my personal. 
 * Give more information about the PVP fight module to users in chat. Like !fight @user, !slash, and @giveup.
